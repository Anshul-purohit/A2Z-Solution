        Competitive Programming simply means doing Programming in Competition. In CP, you have to solve problems
        based on Data Structure and Algorithms while competing with other Programmers.
        Some of the Popular Websites on which you can do CP are :- <br>
        (1) <a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> <br>
        (2) <a href="https://www.codechef.com/learn/dashboard">Codechef</a> <br>
        Now, let's look at what can be the right path for a beginner in CP. <br>
        First of all, you should choose a programming language. You can choose C++ or Java or Python, you don't need
        to learn the language in depth, you just need to know the basics like how to do input / output, for loop, 
        while loop, continue, break, and some knowledge of inbuilt library of the programming language that you chose. <br>
        Now you can start giving contests, the best way to get benefited from a contest is that try to give 100 %
        in contest, don't give up in between, keep trying until contest ends. After giving contest, solve atleast 1 or 2
        problems that you were not able to solve during contest. You can read official editorial or can watch a youtube
        video if available to solve a particular problem. Now, the best part of upsolving is if you counter certain technique, 
        algorithm or data structure that is being used to solve problem, learn it by then and solve 4 to 5 problems based 
        on that, in this way you will get a good grip over that algorithm / data structure.
